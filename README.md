## Why use Docs ❓

⚠️ **Note that Docs provides docs/pdf exporters by loading [two BlockNote packages](https://github.com/suitenumerique/docs/blob/main/src/frontend/apps/impress/package.json#L22C7-L23C53), which we use under the AGPL-3.0 licence. Until we comply with the terms of this license, we recommend that you don't run Docs as a commercial product, unless you are willing to sponsor [BlockNote](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote).**

Docs is a collaborative text editor designed to address common challenges in knowledge building and sharing.

### Write
*   😌 Simple collaborative editing without the formatting complexity of markdown
*   🔌 Offline? No problem, keep writing, your edits will get synced when back online
*   💅 Create clean documents with limited but beautiful formatting options and focus on content
*   🧱 Built for productivity (markdown support, many block types, slash commands, keyboard shortcuts).
*   ✨ Save time thanks to our AI actions (generate, sum up, correct, translate)

### Collaborate
*   🤝 Collaborate with your team in real time
*   🔒 Granular access control to ensure your information is secure and only shared with the right people
*   📑 Professional document exports in multiple formats (.odt, .doc, .pdf) with customizable templates
*   📚 Built-in wiki functionality to turn your team's collaborative work into organized knowledge `ETA 02/2025`

### Self-host
*   🚀 Easy to install, scalable and secure alternative to Notion, Outline or Confluence

## Getting started 🔧

### Test it

Test Docs on your browser by logging in on this [environment](https://impress-preprod.beta.numerique.gouv.fr/)

```
email: test.docs@yopmail.com
password: I'd<3ToTestDocs
```

### Run it locally

> ⚠️ Running Docs locally using the methods described below is for testing purposes only.  It is based on building Docs using Minio as the S3 storage solution but you can choose any S3 compatible object storage of your choice.

**Prerequisite**

Make sure you have a recent version of Docker and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed on your laptop:

```shellscript
$ docker -v
  Docker version 27.4.1, build b9d17ea

Docker version 20.10.2, build 2291f61

$ docker compose version

Docker Compose version v2.32.4
```

> ⚠️ You may need to run the following commands with sudo but this can be avoided by adding your user to the `docker` group.

**Project bootstrap**

The easiest way to start working on the project is to use [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

```shellscript
$ make bootstrap FLUSH_ARGS='--no-input'
```

This command builds the `app` container, installs dependencies, performs database migrations and compile translations. It's a good idea to use this command each time you are pulling code from the project repository to avoid dependency-related or migration-related issues.

Your Docker services should now be up and running 🎉

You can access to the project by going to <http://localhost:3000>.

You will be prompted to log in, the default credentials are:

```
username: impress
password: impress
```

📝 Note that if you need to run them afterwards, you can use the eponym Make rule:

```shellscript
$ make run
```

⚠️ For the frontend developer, it is often better to run the frontend in development mode locally.

To do so, install the frontend dependencies with the following command:

```shellscript
$ make frontend-development-install
```

And run the frontend locally in development mode with the following command:

```shellscript
$ make run-frontend-development
```

To start all the services, except the frontend container, you can use the following command:

```shellscript
$ make run-backend
```

**Adding content**
You can create a basic demo site by running:

```shellscript
$ make demo
```

Finally, you can check all available Make rules using:

```shellscript
$ make help
```

**Django admin**

You can access the Django admin site at

<http://localhost:8071/admin>.

You first need to create a superuser account:

```shellscript
$ make superuser
```
